Key Landscapes for Conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa

Key Landscapes for Conservation (KLC) are areas recognised to be of global wildlife importance with intact ecosystems that are capable of sustaining wildlife populations in the face of increasing isolation from other similar areas (Larger Than Elephants - Inputs for EU strategic approach to wildlife conservation in Africa - Regional Analysis, European Commission, 2016).

In 2019, following discussions with experts, the JRC proposed an update of the layer published in 2016.
This repository holds the scripts used to create the update and to produce some coverage analyses to be published on the BIOPAMA Reference Information System (https://rris.biopama.org).

The 2019 layer was created in QGIS with python.
For the coverage statistics for countries, ecoregions and individual protected areas (vestor data), we used a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS.
For the statistics base on raster data, we used R package raster.
