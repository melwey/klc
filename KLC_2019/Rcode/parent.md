# Context
Key Landscape for Conservation (KLC) were proposed in the European Commission publication "Larger than Elephants" (EC, 2015).
The polygons shown in the report did not always emcompass the target protected areas and their limits were difficult to use in quantitative spatial analyses. We therefore hereby propose new polygons, that will be used for future anaylses.
In the next pages we present a map for each KLC, with the polygon from 2015 and the new proposal, as well as some justification to the modification.

# Proposed modifications

## CAF_01: Cross River-Takamanda-Mt Cameroon-Korup
There is a Copernicus Hotspot for which land cover has been mapped, but we kept a slightly smaller buffer around the target PAs. Faro NP (CMR) has been moved to KLC CAF_17.

## CAF_03: TRIDOM/TNS
We took a 20 km buffer around the target PAs and joined them following the roads.
